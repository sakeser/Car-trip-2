# Revision History and Handoff

This file is the working handoff for the main branch. The UX redesign worktree was intentionally not used for the June 23, 2026 field-test fixes.

For the full Claude Code continuation brief, including UX worktree notes, GNSS/raw-measurement findings, and a prioritized next-step backlog, see `CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md`.

## Current phone build

- Package: `com.cartrip.analyzer`
- Installed on S25: `versionName=2.36`, `versionCode=47`
- Build artifact (relocated, see note): `C:\Users\sinan\cartrip-build-out\app\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
- Maps key: now present in `cartrip-main\local.properties` (gitignored), copied from the original worktree; do not commit or print it.

### Build note: OneDrive lock workaround

OneDrive holds handles on `app/build` (kotlin-classes / snapshot), which breaks incremental
Kotlin compile with `Unable to delete directory`. Builds now relocate output out of OneDrive via an
init script:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --init-script 'C:\Users\sinan\cartrip-build-tools\relocate-build.gradle' :app:assembleDebug --no-daemon
```

The APK then lands under `C:\Users\sinan\cartrip-build-out\app\outputs\...`.

## Rev G (v2.35 / v2.36): functional hardening — branch `rev-g-functional`

Directive: focus on functionality, accuracy, correctness, robustness, sensitivity — not UI. Added
the project's first unit-test suite (23 tests) and used it to verify each fix.

- **Auto-stop end time (P0):** trip end is now placed at the real rest moment (last sample >4 km/h,
  then first stationary sample after it) instead of a fixed +60 s grace ~6 min late. New pure
  `record/AutoStop.kt`, fed by a rolling speed window in `RecordingService`.
- **Robust peak-G:** `FusedEventDetector.maxHorizG` uses p99.5 of horizontal-accel magnitude, not the
  raw max. Verified on real data: trip 784's spurious 1.10 g → 0.29 g; 790's 0.73 g → 0.14 g.
- **Sensor-stall recovery:** now also recovers a mid-trip motion stall, not just startup starvation.
- **Detection accuracy:** swerves gated on speed (≥25 km/h) so routine low-speed turns aren't labelled
  swerves; vertical-bump veto stops potholes fabricating brake/accel events.
- **ETA robustness:** `RoutesClient` retries transient failures with backoff, longer timeouts for long
  routes, and surfaces `lastDiagnostic()` instead of a silent null.
- **Trip naming:** nearest-place matching guarded by a 4 km radius (no more stray GTA landmark for
  out-of-area trips); time-of-day generic fallback. Full reverse-geocoding remains a roadmap item.
- Minor: `DisplayEvents.nearestPoint` trailing-event branch fix; correct `rawFixes` on trip reload.

## Main changes since v2.21

### Restored pre-UX functional work

- Restored the stashed functional changes that had produced the earlier installed `2.26 / 37` build.
- Added `DisplayEvents.kt` for cleaning overlapping raw detector signals into a smaller human-facing event list.
- Restored richer trip detail event presentation, clickable map event markers, and speed-limit preservation through reanalysis.
- Kept work on the main branch/worktree only; the separate UX redesign files were not merged.

### Speed-limit lookup and scoring fixes

- Rewrote `SpeedLimits.kt` to query Overpass in route-corridor chunks instead of one broad city-sized bounding box.
- Added OSM way dedupe, bounds pruning during nearest-way matching, and fail-soft diagnostics.
- Added smoothing for isolated one-point speed-limit mismatches. This avoids false peaks such as one highway point snapping to a nearby 50 km/h road.
- Added transactional speed-limit update in `TripDao.updateTripSpeedLimits(...)` so trip aggregates and per-point limits update together.
- Trip detail now uses route point coverage, not just aggregate trip coverage, to decide whether route coloring is available.
- Existing scored trips now show a `Refresh speed limits` control.

### Field-test findings

- Trip `786` morning commute had 2,488 GPS fixes but only 1 motion sample. GPS continued until trip end; motion stopped near trip start. Later trip `790` recorded about 91k motion samples, so this was likely a sensor callback starvation/startup issue rather than a permanent permission or hardware issue.
- Added sensor-stall mitigation in `RecordingService`: when GPS is alive but motion samples do not arrive after startup, the service unregisters/re-registers sensors up to three times.
- Trip `790` showed `speeding 24% / peak 59 over`. The 24% was supported by the points, but the peak was inflated by isolated limit mismatches. With smoothing, the peak becomes roughly 25 km/h over.

### Recording changes

- Fused Location now requests `500 ms` updates with `250 ms` fastest interval, rather than `1000 ms` / `500 ms`.
- Fused Location callback now processes every location in a delivered batch instead of only `lastLocation`.
- GPS delivery may still be capped by Android/Play Services/GNSS; the app now requests a faster cadence but cannot force the provider to supply it.

### Sensor and data-quality UI

- Data quality now reflects capture health only: motion Hz, GPS Hz, and GPS gaps.
- The old `fusion X%` label was removed from the top badge because it was only forward-axis confidence, not the amount of motion data captured.
- Forward-axis confidence remains in the beta detector section where it has context.

### Trip detail UI changes

- Route maps now fit expanded bounds so the trip initially occupies about two-thirds of the viewport instead of being tightly framed.
- Removed Driving-section percentage bars for braking, turns, acceleration, and jerky exposure from the rendered UI.
- Replaced them with a major-events summary for notable hard braking, hard acceleration, and sharp turns using the cleaned event list.
- Speeding is shown as a readable callout with:
  - time spent over the limit,
  - percent of covered drive,
  - peak recorded speed and matched speed-limit zone.

## Current caveats / next work

- The old `FactorBar` helper remains unused in `TripDetailScreen.kt` and can be removed in a cleanup pass.
- The beta sensor detector should eventually become a validated hybrid detector:
  - GPS provides route/speed context and brake-vs-accel sign.
  - Accelerometer provides true horizontal g and exact event timing.
  - Gyro provides yaw/turn evidence.
  - Vertical acceleration should suppress false brake/turn spikes caused by bumps.
- Consider replacing the single `fusedConfidence` field with clearer fields:
  - sensor capture quality,
  - axis confidence,
  - event agreement.
- Past trips cannot gain extra GPS fixes from the new 2 Hz request. Reanalysis can only recompute from samples that already exist.
